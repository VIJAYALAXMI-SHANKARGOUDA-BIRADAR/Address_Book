# Address Book -Project
A robust, menu-driven Address Book application built in C for managing contacts via the command line. It performs full CRUD operations with input validation and CSV-based persistence crafted using modular design and static memory.

What makes it unique? It mirrors real-world logic with structured arrays, uses formatted I/O for clarity, and stores data in a way that opens seamlessly in Excel. No dynamic memory, no libraries‚Äîjust pure C, precision, and purpose.

# üìù Description
This Address Book project is a command-line application developed in C using structured programming principles. It allows users to manage contact information‚Äîname, phone, and email with full control over:
- Creating new contacts with input validation
- Searching contacts by name, phone, or email (case-insensitive)
- Editing existing contact details
- Deleting contacts with confirmation
- Listing all contacts with optional sorting
- Saving and loading contacts via a CSV file for persistence
The program avoids dynamic memory and external libraries, relying on arrays, structures, and standard file I/O (fopen, fscanf, fprintf).
