# Address_Book
A robust, menu-driven Address Book application built in C for managing contacts via the command line. It performs full CRUD operations with input validation and CSV-based persistence crafted using modular design and static memory.

What makes it unique? It mirrors real-world logic with structured arrays, uses formatted I/O for clarity, and stores data in a way that opens seamlessly in Excel. No dynamic memory, no librariesâ€”just pure C, precision, and purpose.
